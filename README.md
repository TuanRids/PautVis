# 3D Real-time PAUT and Robotics Integration with Ultra-Low Latency

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a cutting-edge system for real-time 3D visualization and robotic integration of Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) data. Designed specifically for high-precision industrial inspection and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), it seamlessly integrates advanced robotics, GPU-accelerated computation (CUDA), and computer vision, operating entirely without external encoders by employing custom-developed synchronization algorithms. The system achieves ultra-low latency data handling, with current frame processing times as low as 0.5 milliseconds (2000+ FPS), significantly surpassing standard industry benchmarks.

## Key Features & Technical Innovations

- **Real-time PAUT Data Visualization:**
  - High-performance GPU rendering using Vulkan and CUDA.
  - Achieves real-time processing at an exceptionally low frame time (~0.5ms/frame, ~2000 FPS).
  - Manages large-scale rendering across multiple view buffers, current size 656x1788 (not maximum) which is totaling over 1.1 million pixels per frame.

- **Advanced Robotics Integration (Encoder-free):**
  - Developed a custom algorithm to synchronize robotic movements with PAUT scans, eliminating the need for traditional encoders.
  - Enables autonomous, precise positional tracking using self-developed algorithms.

- **Computer Vision Integration:**
  - Implements automated object detection with OpenCV and deep-learning methods to dynamically determine scan coordinates.
  - Real-time adaptive scanning for objects without pre-defined coordinates.

- **Robotics Integration & Custom Algorithm Development:**
  - Fully autonomous robotic integration with PAUT, removing dependency on traditional encoders.
  - Developed custom algorithms for real-time synchronization between PAUT data acquisition and robotic control.

- **Upcoming Kernel-Level Optimization (Ring 0 Driver):**
  - Planned development of a custom Ring-0 kernel driver to significantly reduce data transfer latency (current bottleneck at ~1.8ms).
  - Direct memory mapping to kernel space for ultra-low latency data handling and optimized real-time performance.
