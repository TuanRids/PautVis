# **3D Real-time PAUT & Robotics Integration â€“ Ultra-Low Latency GPU Processing**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements an advanced **real-time 3D Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) system**, seamlessly integrated with robotics and accelerated GPU processing (CUDA). Designed for **industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)**, the system achieves ultra-low latency through highly optimized CUDA processing, custom encoder-free robotic synchronization, and a **High-Performance GPU Data Management & I/O Optimization** for real-time PAUT data streaming.

## **Key Features & Innovations**
### **Real-Time GPU Processing:**
- Full **GPU-based PAUT processing pipeline**, eliminating redundant CPU-GPU data transfers.
- Handles **60 MB/s throughput** from PAUT devices, touch to limitation of hardware PAUT devices.
- **Advanced openGL + CUDA rendering** for high-performance visualization.

### **Advanced Robotics Integration (Encoder-Free):**
- Custom **algorithm synchronizes robotic motion** with PAUT scanning without traditional encoders.
- **Adaptive real-time scanning** using OpenCV and deep learning, allowing autonomous detection and tracking of objects without pre-defined coordinates.
- Supports **high-speed robotic movement synchronization**, reducing scan time while maintaining accuracy.

### **Optimized CUDA Performance:**
- **Full parallelization** using CUDA Streams and asynchronous pipelines.
- Minimized **host-device memory transfers** for reduced latency.
- triple-buffered staging technique of High-Performance GPU Computing process throughput over 700Mb/s
  
### **High-Performance Data Management & I/O Optimization:**
- **Custom PAUT data format**, replacing traditional HDF5 to minimize I/O overhead.
- **Optimized binary data structure** for low-latency memory access and real-time processing.
- Implements **chunked data writing (~10MB per chunk)** for efficient large-scale data handling.
- **Direct GPU memory mapping** for improved real-time visualization and computational performance.
- Tailored for **low-latency robotics & high-speed scanning**, outperforming standard industrial storage formats.

### **Upcoming Kernel-Level Optimization (Ring-0 Driver):**
- Planned **Ring-0 kernel driver** for direct memory access and reduced system-level data transfer latency.
- **Bypassing traditional OS I/O bottlenecks** to achieve sub-millisecond data handling performance.
  
# Performance Benchmarks
### **Summary**
This benchmark reflects the latest performance of our PAUT-GPU pipeline after optimization.

| **Metric** | **Result** |
|------------|-----------|
| **PAUT Data Throughput** | **60 MB/s (Hardware Limit)** |
| **Total HPC Frame Time** | **0.2 ms** |
| **FrameRate Hz** | **401 Hz (Limited by PAUT hardware)** |
| **Max Achievable Throughput MB/s** | **~750 MB/s (High-Performance GPU Computing)** |
| **Rendering Resolution** | **656 Ã— 1788 (~1.1 MPixels/frame)** |

### **Pipeline Optimization**
- **Double Buffering** implemented â†’ Reduces GPU idle time.
- **triple-buffered staging** enabled â†’ Achieves **max throughput (311 MB/s theoretically)**.
- **Post-processing & Rendering moved to separate threads** â†’ Minimizes blocking.
- **Final bottleneck:** **PAUT SDK (Olympus) limits data transfer to 60 MB/s.**

### Next Steps for Optimization
- The **current limit is hardware-bound**. Further optimization requires **changes in PAUT SDK** or a **faster hardware interface**.
- **GPU is NOT the bottleneck anymore**. Further improvements must focus on **PAUT Data Acquisition speed**.
- Testing with a higher bandwidth data transfer is recommended if new hardware or firmware updates become available.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming:** Modern **C++23, CUDA**
- **Real-time Processing:** CUDA, OpenMP, Multi-threading
- **Computer Vision & AI:** OpenCV, Deep Learning
- **Robotics Integration:** Custom algorithms for encoder-free robotic control
- **Kernel-Level Optimizations (Upcoming):** Ring-0 driver for further latency reductions
- **Data Management & Storage:** Optimized **binary PAUT format, chunked data writing, memory-mapped storage**

## **Applications**
- **High-precision real-time NDT inspection**
- **Autonomous robotics scanning**
- **Advanced industrial inspections requiring minimal latency**
- **AI-driven adaptive scanning for real-time object tracking**

## **Project Status**
- **Solo-developed** over 6 months with mechanical engineering support.
- **Enhanced real-time data processing pipeline** with **optimized I/O and GPU rendering**.
- **Planned future enhancements** with **kernel-level optimizations (Ring-0 Driver)**.
- **Current implementation surpasses** standard industry benchmarks, setting a new standard for **ultra-low latency PAUT processing**.

## **Why This System Stands Out**
- **Achieves real-time PAUT inspection at hardware limits 60Mb/s throughput.**
- **Pioneers full GPU-side processing** to reach the limit latency, touch to High Performance Computing 300Mb/s.
- **Innovative encoder-free robotic synchronization** and **AI-driven adaptive scanning**.
- **Optimized I/O management** for real-time high-speed PAUT data handling.
