# Real-Time Phased Array Ultrasound: Robotic Integration and GPU-Accelerated Low-Latency Processing

### Phased Array Ultrasound Testing (PAUT) for Real-Time Industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

## Project Overview

This project implements a GPU-accelerated real-time Phased Array Ultrasound Testing (PAUT) system integrated with robotic control and simplified vision-based object positioning. Specifically designed for industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), the system achieves stringent low-latency and throughput targets. Optimizations in CUDA processing, data streaming, and synchronization enable sustained scanning at the hardware-constrained input rate of 60 MB/s, with a practical data acquisition interval of 1.7 ms per frame (~588 Hz).

---

## Key Features & Innovations

### 1. Low-Latency GPU Processing Pipeline
- CUDA-based data pipeline reduces CPU overhead and host-device transfer delays.
- Real-time PAUT scanning achieves sub-millisecond GPU processing latency (~0.15 ms per frame), significantly below typical PAUT hardware latency (2.5 ms).
- Integrated OpenGL and CUDA rendering for smooth, low-latency visualization.

### 2. Encoder-Free Robotic Synchronization
- Completely eliminates physical encoders through a custom-developed synchronization method:
  - Uses real-time GPU-processed ultrasound signals to generate stitchID (beamformed average), providing precise positioning feedback.
  - Incorporates a start-stop mechanism controlled via IO signals from a custom-designed hardware module, measuring real-time robot states without encoders.
  - Planned implementation of an alignment-processing algorithm to minimize positional discrepancies across multiple scans through interpolation techniques.

### 3. Vision-Assisted Positioning (Auxiliary)
- Utilizes Intel RealSense camera to detect approximate XY coordinates for scan initiation.
- Simplified vision system designed for basic spatial alignment purposes (no complex object recognition involved).

### 4. CUDA Optimizations for Real-Time Performance
- GPU-side computation significantly reduces CPU involvement.
- Triple-buffered asynchronous CUDA streaming minimizes latency, maximizing GPU utilization.
- Efficient use of pinned memory and concurrent streams enhances overall throughput.

### 5. Data Management and I/O Optimizations
- Custom binary data format optimized for real-time streaming, replacing traditional formats such as HDF5.
- Chunked data streaming (10 MB chunks) maintains low-latency immediate processing access.
- Current GPU performance primarily constrained by PAUT hardware input limits (60 MB/s).

### 6. Addressing PAUT Beamforming Challenges
- Beamforming interdependencies due to adjacent beam calculations.
- Non-sequential memory access patterns addressed via pipeline staging (Ascan â†’ Beamforming â†’ Scanline).
