## Real-Time Phased Array Ultrasound (PAUT): GPU-Accelerated Robotic Integration for Industrial NDT

### Project Overview
This project develops a GPU-accelerated real-time Phased Array Ultrasound Testing (PAUT) system integrated with robotic control and simplified vision-assisted positioning, designed specifically for industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). The primary objective is achieving stringent latency and throughput benchmarks essential for high-performance industrial inspections, within hardware-imposed constraints (60 MB/s input rate). Optimized CUDA processing, triple-buffered data streaming, and threshold-based synchronization techniques allow sustained real-time data acquisition from PAUT hardware at 588 Hz (1.7 ms per frame), corresponding to a continuous Ethernet input stream of 60 MB/s.
### Key Features and Technical Innovations

#### 1. GPU-Accelerated Low-Latency Pipeline
- Total GPU-side processing latency, including both memory transfers and kernel execution, averages ~0.22 ms per frame, as measured using GPU-side timestamp counters.
- Data transfers are optimized to <0.03 ms via pinned memory and triple-buffered streaming. For reference, CUDA kernel execution alone averages ~0.15 ms/frame, peaking at ~0.35 ms, significantly outperforming standard PAUT hardware latency (~1.7 ms).
- Asynchronous CUDA execution, triple-buffered streaming, and pinned memory techniques minimize CPU-GPU overhead.
- CUDA-OpenGL interoperability is implemented to enable efficient data visualization with minimal overhead

#### 2. Encoder-Free Robotic Synchronization
- Uses GPU-processed ultrasound signals (stitchID) as triggers to initiate and terminate scanning, reducing dependency on physical encoders.
- Positional synchronization is achieved through threshold-based detection combined with simple start-stop robot motion
- Advanced interpolation techniques planned for minimizing positional discrepancies in multiple robotic scans.

#### 3. Simplified Vision-Assisted Positioning
- Intel RealSense camera provides initial spatial reference points before scans, assisting robot alignment. It does not participate directly in real-time scan synchronization due to inherent latency."

#### 4. Optimized Real-Time Data Management
- Custom binary streaming format replaces traditional formats (e.g., HDF5), optimized specifically for immediate processing and low-latency real-time data handling.
- Chunked data streaming (10 MB chunks) ensures continuous data flow without bottlenecks.

#### 5. PAUT Beamforming Challenges
- Structured CUDA kernel pipeline efficiently handles beamforming interdependencies and non-sequential memory accesses (Ascan â†’ Beamforming â†’ Scanline).

*Note: GPU throughput refers to internal computation throughput distinct from external I/O.*

### Software Architecture
The system utilizes a modular architecture:
- **Frame Management:** Implemented via Factory and Observer patterns, facilitating scalable and maintainable data streaming.
- **Critical Parameter and Class Management:** Singleton patterns with carefully managed mutex locks ensure thread safety and consistency.
- **Feature Organization:** Clearly structured folders enabling modularization and abstraction post-R&D phase, allowing for flexible feature integration and maintenance.

### Coding Standards and Practices
- Developed using modern C++20/23 standards, leveraging RAII, smart pointers, and best practices for robust resource management.
- Raw pointers for CUDA memory explicitly managed within encapsulated wrappers, ensuring resource safety and readability.
- Strict adherence to coding standards, static analysis tools, and careful performance profiling ensures reliability and maintainability.

### Validation and Stability Testing
- Extensive validation across multiple samples, including rigorous tests on LG battery samples, with results reviewed by LG experts.
- PAUT results and performance validated and confirmed by ultrasound domain specialists.
- Continuous stability testing under real-world scanning conditions to ensure performance consistency and system robustness.

### Future Enhancements
- Hardware upgrade planned to surpass current 60 MB/s input limitation.
- Development of Ring-0 drivers to enable direct IO triggering from the Yaskawa controller, improving PAUT-robot synchronization and stitching accuracy.
