# **3D Real-time PAUT & Robotics Integration â€“ Ultra-Low Latency GPU Processing**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements an advanced **real-time 3D Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) system**, seamlessly integrated with robotics and accelerated GPU processing (CUDA). Designed for **industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)**, the system achieves ultra-low latency through highly optimized CUDA processing, custom encoder-free robotic synchronization, and a **high-performance I/O management system** for real-time PAUT data streaming.

## **Key Features & Innovations**
### **Real-Time GPU Processing:**
- Full **GPU-based PAUT processing pipeline**, eliminating redundant CPU-GPU data transfers.
- Handles **60 MB/s throughput** from PAUT devices with minimal latency.
- **Advanced Vulkan + CUDA rendering** for high-performance visualization.

### **Advanced Robotics Integration (Encoder-Free):**
- Custom **algorithm synchronizes robotic motion** with PAUT scanning without traditional encoders.
- **Adaptive real-time scanning** using OpenCV and deep learning, allowing autonomous detection and tracking of objects without pre-defined coordinates.
- Supports **high-speed robotic movement synchronization**, reducing scan time while maintaining accuracy.

### **Optimized CUDA Performance:**
- **Full parallelization** using CUDA Streams and asynchronous pipelines.
- Minimized **host-device memory transfers** for reduced latency.

### **High-Performance Data Management & I/O Optimization:**
- **Custom PAUT data format**, replacing traditional HDF5 to minimize I/O overhead.
- **Optimized binary data structure** for low-latency memory access and real-time processing.
- Implements **chunked data writing (~10MB per chunk)** for efficient large-scale data handling.
- **Direct GPU memory mapping** for improved real-time visualization and computational performance.
- Tailored for **low-latency robotics & high-speed scanning**, outperforming standard industrial storage formats.

### **Upcoming Kernel-Level Optimization (Ring-0 Driver):**
- Planned **Ring-0 kernel driver** for direct memory access and reduced system-level data transfer latency.
- **Bypassing traditional OS I/O bottlenecks** to achieve sub-millisecond data handling performance.

## **Performance Benchmarks**
| **Metric** | **Result** |

| **PAUT â†’ Host Latency** | 1.7 ms (Olympus SDK limit) |
| **GPU Processing Time (CUDA)** | 1.3 ms |
| **Total Frame Time** | 0.5 - 1.7 ms |
| **Max Achievable Throughput** | 60 MB/s |
| **Rendering Resolution** | 656 Ã— 1788 (~1.1 MPixels/frame) |
| **Render All scanning Results FPS (Frames Per Second)** | ~2000 FPS |

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming:** Modern **C++23, CUDA**
- **Real-time Processing:** CUDA, OpenMP, Multi-threading
- **Computer Vision & AI:** OpenCV, Deep Learning
- **Robotics Integration:** Custom algorithms for encoder-free robotic control
- **Kernel-Level Optimizations (Upcoming):** Ring-0 driver for further latency reductions
- **Data Management & Storage:** Optimized **binary PAUT format, chunked data writing, memory-mapped storage**

## **Applications**
- **High-precision real-time NDT inspection**
- **Autonomous robotics scanning**
- **Advanced industrial inspections requiring minimal latency**
- **AI-driven adaptive scanning for real-time object tracking**

## **Project Status**
- **Solo-developed** over 6 months with mechanical engineering support.
- **Enhanced real-time data processing pipeline** with **optimized I/O and GPU rendering**.
- **Planned future enhancements** with **kernel-level optimizations (Ring-0 Driver)**.
- **Current implementation surpasses** standard industry benchmarks, setting a new standard for **ultra-low latency PAUT processing**.

## **Why This System Stands Out**
- **Achieves real-time PAUT inspection at hardware limits (0.5 - 1.7 ms/frame).**
- **Pioneers full GPU-side processing** to reach limit latency.
- **Innovative encoder-free robotic synchronization** and **AI-driven adaptive scanning**.
- **Optimized I/O management** for real-time high-speed PAUT data handling.
