# **3D Real-time PAUT & Robotics Integration â€“ Ultra-Low Latency GPU Processing**
### Phased Array Ultrasound Testing Industry integrating with Robotics
### HPC System Engineering (Industry, Real-Time, GPU Processing)

## **Project Overview**
This project is an example of **HPC System Engineering (Industry, Real-Time, GPU Processing)**, implementing an advanced **real-time 3D Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) system**, seamlessly integrated with robotics and accelerated GPU processing (CUDA). Designed for **industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)**, the system achieves ultra-low latency through highly optimized CUDA processing, custom encoder-free robotic synchronization, and a **High-Performance GPU Data Management & I/O Optimization** for real-time PAUT data streaming.

### **Key Features & Innovations**  

#### **1. Real-Time GPU Processing: Ultra-Low Latency**
- Full GPU-based PAUT processing pipeline, eliminating redundant CPU-GPU data transfers.  
- Achieves real-time PAUT inspection at hardware limits **60 MB/s throughput**.  
- **Processes frames 12.5Ã— faster than PAUT hardware requirement (2.5ms â†’ 0.2ms), ensuring ultra-low latency.**  
- Advanced OpenGL + CUDA rendering for high-performance visualization.  

#### **2. Advanced Robotics Integration (Encoder-Free)**
- Custom algorithm synchronizes robotic motion with PAUT scanning without traditional encoders.  
- Adaptive real-time scanning using OpenCV and deep learning, allowing autonomous detection and tracking of objects without pre-defined coordinates.  
- Supports high-speed robotic movement synchronization, reducing scan time while maintaining accuracy.  

#### **3. Optimized CUDA Performance & High-Performance Computing**
- Full parallelization using CUDA Streams and asynchronous pipelines.  
- **GPU-side processing eliminates CPU bottlenecks, reaching real-time PAUT limits.**  
- Minimized host-device memory transfers for reduced latency.  
- Triple-buffered staging technique achieves throughput over **700 MB/s**.  

#### **4. High-Performance Data Management & I/O Optimization**
- Custom PAUT data format replacing HDF5 to minimize I/O overhead.  
- Optimized binary data structure for low-latency memory access and real-time processing.  
- Implements chunked data writing (~10MB per chunk) for efficient large-scale data handling.  
- **Tailored for low-latency robotics & high-speed scanning, outperforming standard industrial storage formats.**  
- **GPU is no longer the bottleneck; PAUT SDK limits data transfer to 60 MB/s.**  

#### **5. Upcoming Kernel-Level Optimization (Ring-0 Driver)**
- Planned Ring-0 kernel driver for direct memory access and reduced system-level data transfer latency.  
- Bypassing traditional OS I/O bottlenecks to achieve sub-millisecond data handling performance.

# Performance Benchmarks
### **Summary**
This benchmark reflects the latest performance of our PAUT-GPU pipeline after optimization.

| **Metric** | **Result** |
|------------|-----------|
| **PAUT Data Throughput** | **60 MB/s (Hardware Limit)** |
| **Total HPC Process Speed** | **0.2 ms** |
| **FrameRate Hz** | **401 Hz (Limited by PAUT hardware)** |
| **Max Achievable Throughput MB/s** | **~750 MB/s (High-Performance GPU Computing)** |
| **Rendering Resolution** | **656 Ã— 1788 (~1.1 MPixels/frame)** |

### **Pipeline Optimization**
- **Double Buffering** implemented â†’ Reduces GPU idle time.
- **triple-buffered staging** enabled â†’ Achieves **max throughput (311 MB/s theoretically)**.
