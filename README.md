## Real-Time Phased Array Ultrasound (PAUT): GPU-Accelerated Robotic Integration for Industrial NDT

### Project Overview
This project develops a GPU-accelerated real-time Phased Array Ultrasound Testing (PAUT) system integrated with robotic control and simplified vision-assisted positioning, specifically designed for industrial Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). The primary objective is achieving stringent latency and throughput benchmarks essential for high-performance industrial inspections, constrained by hardware limitations (60 MB/s input rate). Leveraging optimized CUDA kernels, CUDA Graphs, triple-buffered streaming, and threshold-based synchronization techniques, the system sustains real-time data acquisition from PAUT hardware at 588 Hz (1.7 ms/frame), corresponding to a continuous Ethernet input stream of 60 MB/s.

### Key Features and Technical Innovations

#### 1. GPU-Accelerated Low-Latency Pipeline
- Total GPU-side processing latency averages ~0.11 ms/frame (core kernel pipeline: `AscanProcessing` + `[MakeBView/computeMax]` + `CView`).
- Data transfers optimized (<0.03 ms/frame) via pinned memory and enhanced triple-buffering techniques.
- CUDA Graphs integration stabilizes kernel execution, minimizing overhead and further reducing peak latency.

#### 2. Encoder-Free PAUT Synchronization
- GPU-generated ultrasound signals in PAUT by using (`stitchID`) trigger, combined with robotic start-stop linear operations, eliminating physical encoder dependency.
- Threshold-based detection achieves precise positional synchronization, simplifying robotic motion.
- Planned interpolation improvements via IO board and Ring-0 driver integration for precise hardware-level triggering

#### 3. Simplified Vision-Assisted Positioning
- Intel RealSense camera provides initial spatial reference for robotic alignment without direct real-time synchronization due to latency constraints.

#### 4. Optimized Real-Time Data Management
- Custom binary streaming format optimized for immediate processing and minimal latency.
- Continuous, chunked data streaming (10 MB chunks) maintains consistent throughput without bottlenecks.

#### 5. PAUT Beamforming Challenges
- Structured CUDA kernel pipeline efficiently resolves beamforming interdependencies and complex memory access patterns (`Ascan â†’ Beamforming â†’ Scanline`).
